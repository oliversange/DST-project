# DST-project
Dynamical systems theory course final project at the University of Heidelberg 2025.

The code builds on the model described in Deep Transformer Models for Time Series Forecasting: The Influenza Prevalence Case by Wu et al..

The implementation is based on the tutorial by [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-a-pytorch-transformer-for-time-series-forecasting-69e073d4061e), available at https://github.com/KasperGroesLudvigsen/influenza_transformer.
